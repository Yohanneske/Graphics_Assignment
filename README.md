# 🌌 OpenGL Solar System Simulation

This project is a real-time 3D simulation of the Solar System built using **C++** and **OpenGL**. It features textured planets, realistic lighting, and animations for orbit and rotation to visually represent our planetary system.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Phong lighting (ambient, diffuse, specular)
- ✅ Texture mapping on all planets
- ✅ Independent rotation and revolution for each planet
- ✅ Smooth animations
- ✅ Saturn's ring with custom mesh and texture
- ✅ Camera controls (WASD + mouse look)
- ✅ Orbits visualization

## 🛠️ Requirements

- **C++ compiler**
- **OpenGL 3.3+**
- **GLFW** (for window/context/input)
- **GLAD** (for OpenGL function loading)
- **GLM** (for vector/matrix math)
- **stb_image** (for texture loading)

## 📦 Building

1. **Clone or extract the repository.**
2. Make sure all dependencies are available (GLFW, GLAD, GLM, stb_image).
3. Use CMake to generate build files:
    ```sh
    .\build_cmake.bat
    ```
   Or use the provided [build_cmake.bat](http://_vscodecontentref_/0) on Windows.

4. Run the resulting executable (e.g., [main.exe](http://_vscodecontentref_/1)).
   ```sh
    build/main.exe 
   ```
